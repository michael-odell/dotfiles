termtitle() {

    # What I read suggests that there are these escape sequences relevant to window titles:
    #
    #  OSC 0: Set window icon and title
    #  OSC 1: Sometimes used for tab title
    #  OSC 2: Set just title without icon
    #
    # Handling by terminal:
    #
    # iterm2:
    #   sets both window title and tab title to this unless you've also used OSC 1 (see tabtitle)
    #
    # tmux:
    #   will honor both OSC 0 or OSC 2 for this and stores the value in `pane_title`
