-- Configuration

--- Snapster.showAlert
--- Variable
--- A boolean that determines whether to show an alert when a window is resized.
---
--- Notes:
---  * The default is `true`
obj.showAlert = true

--- Snapster.maxHistorySize
--- Variable
--- The maximum number of window states to keep in history.
---
--- Notes:
---  * The default is 10
---  * Set to 0 to disable history
obj.maxHistorySize = 10

--- Snapster.defaults
--- Variable
--- A table of default window settings for the Snapster spoon.
obj.defaults = {
    width = nil,
    height = nil,

    maximumWidth = nil,
    maximumHeight = nil,

    minimumWidth = nil,
    minimumHeight = nil,
}

--- Snapster.apps
--- Variable
--- Override the default window settings for specific applications.
---
--- The table consists of application names as keys and a table of settings as values.
--- Settings may include any option from the defaults table.  Only settings that are
--- specified will override the defaults.
---
--- Example:
---   snapster.apps = {
---     ["Google Chrome"] = {width = 1280, height = 900},
---     ["Code"] = {minimumWidth = 1600},
---   }
obj.apps = {}

--- Snapster.scale
--- Variable
--- A table of predefined scaling factors.
obj.scale = {
    halfWidth = FrameScaler.HALF_WIDTH,
    halfHeight = FrameScaler.HALF_HEIGHT,
    fullScreen = FrameScaler.FULL_SCREEN,
    quarterScreen = FrameScaler.QUARTER_SCREEN,
}

--- Snapster.anchor
--- Variable
--- A table of predefined screen anchors.
obj.anchor = {
    left = ScreenAnchor.LEFT_SIDE,
    right = ScreenAnchor.RIGHT_SIDE,
    top = ScreenAnchor.TOP_OF_SCREEN,
    bottom = ScreenAnchor.BOTTOM_OF_SCREEN,
    topLeft = ScreenAnchor.TOP_LEFT,
    bottomLeft = ScreenAnchor.BOTTOM_LEFT,
    topRight = ScreenAnchor.TOP_RIGHT,
    bottomRight = ScreenAnchor.BOTTOM_RIGHT,
    fullScreen = ScreenAnchor.FULL_SCREEN
}

--- Snapster.resize
--- Variable
--- A table of predefined window sizes.
obj.resize = {
    config = FrameResizer:new(),
    xsmall = FrameResizer.QVGA,
    small = FrameResizer.VGA,
    medium = FrameResizer.XGA,
    large = FrameResizer.SXGA,
    xlarge = FrameResizer.WUXGA
}

--- keyname(mods, key)
--- Function
--- Builds a consistent string representation of a hotkey combination.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * mods - An array of modifier keys (e.g., {"cmd", "alt"})
---  * key - A string representing the key (e.g., "s" or "return")
---
--- Returns:
---  * A standardized string representation of the hotkey (e.g., "alt-cmd-S")
---
--- Notes:
---  * Modifier keys are sorted and converted to lowercase
---  * The key is converted to uppercase
---  * This is used internally to create consistent keys for the hotkeys table
local function keyname(mods, key)
    -- Sort the modifiers for consistent naming
    table.sort(mods)

    local name = table.concat(mods, "-")
    return name:lower() .. "-" .. key:upper()
end

--- Snapster:getEffectiveConfig(app)
--- Method
--- Returns the effective configuration for an application by combining default settings with app-specific overrides.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * app - An hs.application object representing the application
---
--- Returns:
---  * A table containing the effective configuration settings for the application
function obj:getEffectiveConfig(app)
    local appname = app and app:name() or nil
    local config = {}
    
    -- Start with defaults
    for k, v in pairs(self.defaults) do
        config[k] = v
    end
    
    -- Override with app-specific settings if they exist
    if appname and self.apps[appname] then
        for k, v in pairs(self.apps[appname]) do
            config[k] = v
        end
    end
    
    return config
end

--- Snapster:_apply(layouts)
--- Method
--- Internal method that applies a list of layouts to the currently focused window.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * layouts - A table of layout objects to apply in sequence
---
--- Notes:
---  * Each layout object in the list must have an apply() method that takes a window object
---  * If showAlert is true, displays an alert with the window dimensions after applying layouts
function obj:_apply(layout)
    local win = hs.window.focusedWindow()

    if not win then
