# To initialize kopia for a given machine:
#
#  1. Set up the vault with something like this (for local -- other create subcommands options exist for
#     other backup target types).
#
#     WARNING: This stores the local password in plaintext.  Since the files are all local, that seems
#     reasonable enough to me, but you probably don't want to do that for remote vaults.
#
#       kopia repository create filesystem --no-use-keychain --persist-credentials --path=TARGET_PATH_HERE
#       kopia policy set --global --compression=zstd
#
#  2. Back up the directories you want controlled -- the full set of files you back up will continue to
#     be used by the automated job that creates new snapshots periodically.
#
#       kopia snapshot create $HOME/.zsh $HOME/contrib $HOME/src
#
#  3. Enable the service to back them up
#
#       # MAYBE first have to launchctl enable user/$UID/us.theodells.kopia.backup
#       launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/us.theodells.kopia.backup.plist
